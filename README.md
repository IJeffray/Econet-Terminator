# Acorn Econet Terminator, for "phantom power" networks.

March 2023


![3D View](Generated/EconetTerminator_3D_View.PNG)

This is my implementation of a terminator for Econet Networks that provide 'phantom power' - such as the SJ Networks clock or BeebMaster clock.
It's not suitable for networks where powered termination is required.

The board is ridiculously small, and fits inside a standard DIN Econet plug.

It has been successfully tested on small 'desktop' Econet networks.
